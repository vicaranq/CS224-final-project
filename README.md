# CS224-final-project
For our final project, we decided to do sentiment analysis on Twitter tweets due to the wide availability of Twitter data and the interesting expansion of natural language understanding on less formal text.  Tweets are known to use abbreviations, tags, emojis, and lack syntactic structure that can be relied on in most other tasks such as capitalization, full spelling and conventional acronyms.  This relates to three core topics covered in the course: vector space models, sentiment analysis, and named-entity recognition.  In the papers we chose, we explore opportunities to reduce computational complexity to utilize a bigger training set and improve training times, identifying positive negative sentiment on tweets, and how to analyze tweets given certain features or lack of features prominent in tweets. Furthermore, we explore recent work on Named Entity Recognition for Tweets to explore how we could leverage this NLP task to extract products or company tags from noisy and not-well-structured text.
